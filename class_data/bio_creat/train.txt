The 0
gene 0
for 0

on 0

encodes 0
a 0
novel 0
protein 0
named 0
emerin 0
that 0
localizes 0
at 0
the 0
nuclear 0

skeletal 0
, 0

smooth 0
muscles 0
and 0

. 0

To 0
investigate 0
a 0

role 0
for 0

, 0
we 0
examined 0
the 0

We 0
found 0
that 0

These 0
results 0
suggest 0
that 0
emerin 0
anchors 0
at 0
the 0

through 0
